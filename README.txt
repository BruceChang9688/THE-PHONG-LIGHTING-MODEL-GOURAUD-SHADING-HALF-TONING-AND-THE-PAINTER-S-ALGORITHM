Welcome to Project3 README

This program deals with Phong Lighting Model, Gouraud Shading, Half-toning and Painter's Algorithm.

First, please type in your file address.
Then the program will create the original object from the file by using Gouraud Shading and Painter's Algorithm.

If you want to make more operations, please press 'o'.

Now we can use phong model in this part, press '1' to continue phong model.
Yep, here is the Phong Lighting model Settings. 
You can set up:
Ka, the color of ambient light;
Ia, intensity of ambient light;
Il, intensity of light source;
K, distance that light source to the face;
f, the location of eye;
p, light source point;
Ks, the color of light source.
Of course you can skip the Phong model to keep the color by pressing '0'.

After phong model part, you can choose wether use a halftone mode.
Press '1' for black and white halftone mode.
Press '2' for RGB halftone mode.
Press '0' for not using this mode.

You can still press 'o' to have another operation to this object.
